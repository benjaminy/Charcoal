  The line that caught my attention here was: "the path gets written to by another client
  between the check and write". It appears, then, as if the programmer expected the 'check'
  and 'write' operation to be an atomic block of code, which it wasn't.

  "We experienced an issue where on login the sessions request is fired at the same time as
  the login request, so it hasn't had time to process the login.
  For the haskell backend this is fine, but for backends where GET /sessions
  requires authentication it is a problem."

  This seems to be an instance of unwanted asynchronous behavior, and the
  programmer hasn't taken appropriate measures to achieve it synchronousness,
  hence atomicity violation. An atomic block would be helpful!
