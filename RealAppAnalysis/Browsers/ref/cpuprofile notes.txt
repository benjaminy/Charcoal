The purpose of this document is to provide a reference to how Chrome's JavaScript Profiler interprets its output file, .cpuprofile.
To my knowledge, there does not exist any official documentation on it.
I am treating this a dump for ideas on how it works.

- Comprises JSON data
- Nodes appear to be a basic unit for the JS Profile
   - Indicated by "callframe" attribute

- Functions that call other functions have 

 - Affecting the following values modify how the profiler interprets function runtime duration
   - hitCounts
   - start time / end time
   - positionTicks
   that said, the individual values of these attributes affect the runtime interpretations of other nodes...
