Background for the summer project with Clara & Miguel:
- Very broad, old-ish background on the challenges of concurrency:
  - https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/papers/threads.pdf
  - https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/papers/threads-hotos-2003.pdf
- More recent references TBD
- What I am expecting us to do:
  - Instrument JS ecosystems (browsers, node, electron, others?)
  - Collect traces of event callbacks from real applications
  - Analyze these traces for potentially problematic patterns
- What I am hoping/expecting to find:
  - Many applications are composed of tons of extremely short callbacks.
    Sometimes there are chains of callbacks that typically execute in short succession.
    If some other action happened in the middle of such a chain, it could cause a concurrency bug.

First steps:
- Gain familiarity with JavaScript event logging/tracing tools. For example (these are just starting points):
  - https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/events
  - https://nodejs.org/api/tracing.html
