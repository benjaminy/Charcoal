 - Progress was made in identifiying callbacks using simple test JavaScript programs.
 - Using event categories v8 and v8.execute (credit to Ben), I was able to see how the event tracer profiles callbacks. Namely, in
   the case of setTimeout(), it appears as ScheduleAction::execute; profiles of callbacks outside of functions such as setTimeout()
   seem to appear as sequences of events, instead of stacks of functions, but I find this odd and will continue to look at this.
 - Also, I will look into how to use the event tracer with other developer tools, mainly the inspector, to achieve greater control
   over the execution of a program.

 - Progress was made in understanding a trace profile
 - There are obstacles in extracting wanted data
    1. There are a lot of events being traced irrelevant to our purposes
    2. Lack of definition in function calls
 - Effort will be made in identifying useful data by tracing simple JavaScript / HTML programs. This will help me understand what
   to look for in a event trace of a complex application

Background for the summer project with Clara & Miguel:
- Very broad, old-ish background on the challenges of concurrency:
  - https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/papers/threads.pdf
  - https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/papers/threads-hotos-2003.pdf
- More recent references TBD
- What I am expecting us to do:
  - Instrument JS ecosystems (browsers, node, electron, others?)
  - Collect traces of event callbacks from real applications
  - Analyze these traces for potentially problematic patterns
- What I am hoping/expecting to find:
  - Many applications are composed of tons of extremely short callbacks.
    Sometimes there are chains of callbacks that typically execute in short succession.
    If some other action happened in the middle of such a chain, it could cause a concurrency bug.

First steps:
- Gain familiarity with JavaScript event logging/tracing tools. For example (these are just starting points):
  - https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/events
  - https://nodejs.org/api/tracing.html
