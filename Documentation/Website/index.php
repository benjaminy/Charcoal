<p>Charcoal is a programming language project.  Its defining
characteristics are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Charcoal is a C dialect
  <ul>
    <li>Mostly source-compatible with C
    <li>Calling C from Charcoal and vice-versa works with minimal fuss
    <li>Follows the "C philosophy"
  </ul>
  <li>Charcoal makes the design and implementation of
  concurrent/reactive/interactive software more accessible to
  application programmers
</ul>
<p>Charcoal is currently in a very early stage of development.  As of
this writing there is no Charcoal implementation, though work on one has
begun.</p>
